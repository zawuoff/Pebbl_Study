PLACE YOUR VOSK MODEL HERE
==========================

Copy your extracted Vosk model folder directly into this directory.

Expected structure:
assets/
├── vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15/    <-- Copy this entire folder here
│   ├── am/
│   ├── conf/
│   ├── graph/
│   ├── ivector/
│   └── (other model files)
└── PLACE_VOSK_MODEL_HERE.txt (this file - you can delete it after)

STEPS:
1. Locate your extracted "vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15" folder
2. Copy the ENTIRE folder (not just its contents)
3. Paste it directly in this "assets" directory
4. The path should be: app/src/main/assets/vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15/

After copying, rebuild your project and the model will be automatically
extracted to the app's data directory on first launch.

See VOSK_SETUP.md in project root for detailed instructions.
